## Developer Menu

The developer menu has debugging
commands for troubleshooting the app.
They are not officially supported and can change at any time.

We'll use the first two commands:
- Import Database
- Export Database

Each coin has its own database. You need to export every coin separately
but you trigger all the exports at once.
