## Account Migration

Let's delve into a Zcash account in version 1.2.16. Pay attention to the first few characters of the address, starting with "zs." 
This signifies that it's a Sapling shielded address, a critical aspect of Zcash's privacy features.
Transactions to these addresses are fully encrypted and hidden from prying eyes, protecting your financial information 
from third-party agents.

In NU-5, the Zcash protocol ushered in a novel era of private transaction. By introducing a brand new proving system
called Halo 2 that does not require a trusted setup, 
the protocol opened up new avenues for securing transactions and safeguarding assets.

Along with these improvements, Zcash now has a new address type and a new pool of funds.

Prior to YWALLET 1.2.17, we had only sapling addresses available, but now a unified address type is in place, 
offering greater flexibility and convenience.

Unified addresses start with `u1` and combines a transparent, sapling and *orchard*
recipient. It is important to note that your funds remain accessible. The sapling notes you received prior to the 
migration are still fully functional and can be utilized without the need for rescanning.

The upgrade to the new system should be completed in a matter of seconds, making the migration process swift and seamless.

## Transfer funds to Orchard

Presently, the funds remain in the Sapling pool. However, using the Pool Transfer feature, it is possible to move 
them to the Orchard pool. Let's demonstrate this process.

To initiate the transfer, choose "Sapling" as the "From Pool" and "Orchard" as the "To Pool." If you wish to transfer 
all the funds in the Sapling pool, simply tap the "MAX" button. Of course, if you prefer, you can select a smaller 
amount to keep some of your funds in the Sapling pool.

In the transaction pre-flight page, you will see a summary of the transaction before it is executed. 
YWALLET calculates the most private transaction possible, but in this instance, maximum privacy cannot be achieved as 
the transfer of funds from one pool to another necessarily reveals the amounts being moved. 
This is inherent to the protocol as it requires transparency of amounts entering and exiting pools.

Users of YWALLET have the option to set a minimum privacy level for their transactions. 
In the event that the desired privacy level cannot be achieved, the transaction will be blocked for protection. 
However, for those who wish to proceed with the transaction despite the lower privacy level, 
a simple override can be performed by firmly pressing and holding the 'Send' button."

With the transaction initiated, the funds are now being transferred to the Orchard pool. 
The user only needs to pay the miner's fee, which at present, is set at 0.00001 ZEC. 
As a result, the user will observe an unconfirmed payment for this amount.

Upon successful confirmation of the transaction by the network, the newly created Orchard notes will be displayed in the
'Notes' panel. It is worth noting that Sapling notes and Orchard notes are differentiated by their distinctive colors,
providing a clear visual representation of the user's privacy portfolio.

We are now ready to use this Orchard note to make a payment to another Unified Address. The process remains the same 
as in earlier versions of YWALLET, with payments initiated through the 'Send' page. It is important to highlight that
YWALLET has expanded its capabilities and now supports any type of Unified Address, including multi-receiver Unified Addresses,
providing the user with even more versatility and options for privacy-focused transactions.

In an effort to maintain the highest level of privacy for each transaction, YWALLET utilizes every aspect of a Unified Address 
to optimize privacy. This may result in the splitting of a payment into multiple outputs, but the user need not take any action
as this process is seamlessly performed by the application.

As with all transactions, the user has the ability to review the details of the payment before it is sent out. 
In this case, with the presence of an Orchard receiver on the destination address, 
YWALLET is able to make a fully private transaction. 
This results in a transaction with 'HIGH' privacy, providing the user with an added layer of security and peace of mind.
The ability to review transactions and the use of the latest privacy technology make YWALLET a standout choice for secure
and private transactions.

With all necessary information in place, the transaction is ready to be sent out. Simply tapping the 'Send' button 
initiates the transfer. It is worth mentioning that in this instance, the minimum privacy requirement has been met, 
so there is no need for an override.

The transaction is now underway and can be tracked using the transaction ID. 
Upon checking the account balance, it is evident that the remaining funds have been transferred out.
The transaction is recorded in the 'History' page, providing the user with a clear and concise record of their transactions.
