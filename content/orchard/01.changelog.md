The Zcash accounts are automatically migrated to UA.
If you need to show a legacy sapling address, use the Payment
URI QR code generator and only select the Z address type.

- Snap/Diversified addresses are unified now. They don't include
a transparent receiver because these cannot be diversified.
- You can set the default address type for all accounts in the settings.

# Send Page

{{% img "2023-01-06_06-31-10.png" %}}


- The content of the send page is saved as a draft until you make
a transaction. 
- It can also be saved/restored as "Send Templates". See next section
for more information
- Split notes is no longer available. This feature is moved to the 
Pool Transfer page.
- There is a slider with 5% increment marks if you want to send a fraction
of your current balance.
- If "Include Fee in Amount" is set, the transaction fee will be deducted
from the amount received. Otherwise, the sender pays for the fees on
top of the amount specified.
- When the user chooses "MAX", the entire balance is sent out but the
recipient pays for the fees.

# Fees
The fees amount will vary with the transaction structure in the upcoming
changes. Therefore the wallet has to compute the transaction inputs/outputs
before it can report the actual fees. In anticipation for this update,
the fees are no longer shown in the send page.

# Transaction Pre-flight report

{{% img "2023-01-06_06-26-05.png" %}}

- Before making a transaction, YWallet shows a summary of the inputs/
outputs and fees.
- YWallet computes the most private transaction but it may not be the
cheapest. 
- The user has a final opportunity to cancel the transaction if it
is not to their satisfaction.
- The privacy level is determined by the amount of information revealed
and has 4 levels: Very Low, Low, Medium and High.

# Send Templates

- Users can save/load the content of the send page.
- If they chose a fiat currency, it will be restored too even if it
does not match the current fiat currency.
- This simplifies making repeated payments.

# Pool Transfer Page
{{% img "2023-01-06_16-29-36.png" %}}

- The allocation of funds in the various pools (transparent, 
sapling and eventually orchard) is shown at the top.
- Use this menu to carry out t2z, z2t and z2z transactions.
- Optionally split large notes into smaller denominations.
- The changes goes back to the original pool.

# Budget

- The addresses shown in the budget page are broken down by receiver
- It may not be the same if you send to multi receiver UA since
Ywallet may split a payment into several receivers

# Backup

- The secret key shown in the backup page only covers the Sapling side.
- Orchard secret keys do not have a display format.
- In general, the backup seed phrase is what you should save and keep.

# Miscellanous

- The settings page changes based on the current account. If it's a Zcash
account, it will show the Zcash options.
- Server selection is a "simple" setting.
- Auto shield transparent balance is removed. Now you need to use
the shield button or the fund transfer page. Several users thought
their funds were lost because of auto-shielding.
