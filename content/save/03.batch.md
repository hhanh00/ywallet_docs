compatible with the old backups.

The new batch backups are portable between
devices and use standard tools. They include
account information and **synchronization data**.

> For example, you can synchronize on a fast desktop
> computer, make a batch backup and restore on your phone.
> This can save you hours of work and a lot of bandwidth.

If, for some reason, you are not able to use
YWallet anymore but you have a backup, then
you can restore the content by using standard
third-party utilities.

## Batch backups

Batch backups are copies of all the 
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
database files
archived in a [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) 
file, then encrypted using 
[AGE](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age).

## Encryption Key

YWallet can generate a new encryption key for you or you can use
the official AGE keygen tool.

Your decryption key (secret key) begins with `AGE-SECRET-KEY-`.
Your encryption key (public key) begins with `age...`

The encryption key is saved in YWallet but if the application is uninstalled
it will be lost. The decryption key is **not saved**.

The public key can be recomputed from the secret key with the command line utility `age-keygen`
Refer to the official website for more info.

## Save

Choose "Save Batch" option, enter your *public* key if you haven't and wait for the app
to make a backup. It will take a few seconds. By default, the backup is called `YWallet.age`.
Feel free to use a different name.

## Restore

Choose "Restore Batch", enter your *secret* key and select the backup file. If the decryption
is successful, you'll get a message and be asked to restart the app.

Restoration takes place the next time you launch the app.

## Manual decryption

- Create an identity file `id.txt` with your secret key in it. 
- Decrypt the backup file
- Unzip the archive
- Browse the databases

```sh
$ age -d -i id.txt YWallet.age > YWallet.zip
$ unzip YWallet.zip
$ sqlite3 zec.db
```
