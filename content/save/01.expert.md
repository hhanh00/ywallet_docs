## Developer Menu

The developer menu has debugging
commands for troubleshooting the app.
They are not officially supported and can change at any time.

We'll use the first two commands:
- Import Database
- Export Database

Each coin has its own database. You need to export every coin separately
but you trigger all the exports at once.

The last entry "Revoke Dev Mode" disables the Expert Menu.
